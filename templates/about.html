        <h5 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">WTI CRUDE OIL PRICE PREDICTOR</h5>
        <h6 class="mb-2 text-sm font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-800 dark:text-white">Since the 1970s, oil prices have experienced complex fluctuations. These fluctuations are mostly related to historical events such as the first and second Gulf War, and the global financial crisis of 2008. The last decade was marked by a collapse of the oil market in 2014/2015 followed a few years later by the pandemic that caused an unprecedented fall in prices. Recently, on Monday, April 21, 2020, the price of U.S. crude oil turned negative for the first time in history, forcing producers to pay buyers to take the barrels that they could not store due to the oversupply of oil. This situation is a direct result of failed negotiations between Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reduce daily barrel production and the drop in oil demand due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Energy consumption in general, and oil demand in particular, have decreased as offices shut and industrial activity slowed sharply with government travel and work restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

          Despite the announced energy transition in many parts of the world, oil is one of the main sources of energy. Crude oil in particular is a major asset in the commodities market. The crude oil price has exhibited considerable fluctuations over the past decade (Perifanis and Dagoumas, 2019). In addition, the observed variations in oil prices have a significant impact on financial markets and the real economy of countries (Li et al., 2020). In this line, the debates surrounding the behavior of oil prices are of ongoing interest to academics, policymakers, and investors (Caspi et al., 2018). This interest is even more important when prices deviate from fundamental values and a price bubble phenomenon is observed. It is always important to question the detection of oil price bubbles; their underlying causes, and their lifetimes help inform financial authorities. Policy makers will then take care to prevent the formation of bubbles and to manage their eventual explosion through appropriate regulations. We detect a common bubble in oil markets during March and April 2020, i.e., during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. We identify a period of explosive behavior in Brent crude oil prices between March 6 and April 2, 2020, but two short periods of explosive behavior in WTI crude oil prices between March 30, 2020 and April 21, 2020. Brent and WTI oil prices fell by 85 percent between January 2020 and April 21, 2020 before recovering in May 2020. We also identify two short periods of explosive behavior in diesel prices between March 16–30, and between April 27–28, 2020, and in gasoline prices between March 11–30, 2020.</h2>
